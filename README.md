# wft-analyst-git-training
A temporary repository for doing a hands on workshop with WfT analysts

We're gonna write a story..

1. Everyone contribute a line on the master branch
2. Everyone update the story via a 'feature' branch and merge it in via pull requests
3. Make conflicting changes on two branches and try merging them both to master
4. Open season for questions, trying interesting scenarios out, etc.
